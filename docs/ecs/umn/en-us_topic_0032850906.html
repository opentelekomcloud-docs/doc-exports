<h1 class="topictitle1">Why Does a Blank Screen Appear While the System Displays a Message Indicating Successful Authentication After I Attempted to Log In to an <span id="text1973994516498">ECS</span> Using VNC?</h1>
<div id="body1467958938133"><p id="EN-US_TOPIC_0032850906__p64694915142740">Another user has logged in to this <span id="EN-US_TOPIC_0032850906__text846022963914">ECS</span> using VNC.</p>
<p id="EN-US_TOPIC_0032850906__p8060118">Only one user can log in to an <span id="EN-US_TOPIC_0032850906__text725943017394">ECS</span> using VNC at a time. If multiple users attempt to log in to an ECS at the same time, only the first user can log in to it. For other users, the system displays a message indicating that the user is authenticated, but the screen turns blank. If this occurs, wait until the other user logs out of the ECS.</p>
