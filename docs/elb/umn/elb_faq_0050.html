If sticky sessions are enabled and there are few clients, traffic may be unevenly distributed.</li><li id="elb_faq_0050__li1113872252910">Check the health of backend servers, especially those whose health changes over time. If the health check result is <strong id="elb_faq_0050__b84235270612021">Unhealthy</strong> or switches between <strong id="elb_faq_0050__b62279156712054">Healthy</strong> and <strong id="elb_faq_0050__b196399472312054">Unhealthy</strong>, traffic is unbalanced.</li><li id="elb_faq_0050__li15138222122920">Check whether the <strong id="elb_faq_0050__b84235270614950">Source IP hash</strong> algorithm is used. If the algorithm is used, requests sent from the same IP address are routed to the same backend server, resulting in unbalanced traffic.</li><li id="elb_faq_0050__li513814222293">Check whether applications on the backend server use keepalive to maintain TCP persistent connections. If keepalive is used, traffic may be unbalanced because the number of requests on persistent connections is different.</li><li id="elb_faq_0050__li18138522192914">Check whether different weights are assigned to backend servers. The traffic varies according to the weights.</li></ol>
