<p id="elb_qs_0001__p8060118">Two examples are given to show how you can quickly create <span id="elb_qs_0001__ph1645535710329">a shared</span> load balancer to distribute incoming traffic across backend servers.</p>

Health checks are required to monitor the health of backend <span id="elb_qs_0001__text1121191217221">server</span>s to ensure that incoming traffic is routed only to healthy backend <span id="elb_qs_0001__text16161113510316">server</span>s to eliminate SPOFs and improve service availability.<span class="figcap"><b>Figure 1 </b>Entry level</span><br><span><img class="vsd" id="elb_qs_0001__image171053318320" src="en-us_image_0198607819.png"></span>
