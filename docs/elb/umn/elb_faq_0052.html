If their CPU usage reaches 100%, applications may have performance bottlenecks.</li><li id="elb_faq_0052__li1640419457346">Check the incoming traffic. If the incoming traffic exceeds the maximum bandwidth set for the EIP, a large number of packets will be lost and requests will not be responded to, thereby affecting the load balancer's performance.</li><li id="elb_faq_0052__li791993451610">Check the number of short connections in the <strong id="elb_faq_0052__b1531518182445">time_wait</strong> state on the clients. A possible cause is that there are insufficient client ports.</li><li id="elb_faq_0052__li1140474503412">The listening queue backlog of the backend servers is full. As a result, the backend server does not respond to SYN ACK packets, and the client times out. You can increase the upper limit of the backlog by adjusting the <strong id="elb_faq_0052__b8423527061595">net.core.somaxconn</strong> parameter.</li></ol>
