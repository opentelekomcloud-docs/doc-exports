<h1 class="topictitle1">How ELB Works</h1>
<p id="elb_pro_0003__p511191615473">To balance the load of your applications, create a load balancer to receive requests from clients and route the requests to backend <span id="elb_pro_0003__text748892718455">server</span>s in one or more AZs. Add at least a listener to the load balancer and associate at least a backend server with it. The load balancing algorithm you select when you add the listener determines how requests are distributed.</p>

<ul id="elb_pro_0003__ul62874421822"><li id="elb_pro_0003__li1728610427215">Weighted round robin: Requests are routed to different servers based on their weights, which indicate server processing performance. Backend servers with higher weights receive proportionately more requests, whereas equal-weighted servers receive the same number of requests. This algorithm is often used for short connections, such as HTTP connections.<p id="elb_pro_0003__p16438104524911"><a name="elb_pro_0003__li1728610427215"></a><a name="li1728610427215"></a>The following figure shows an example of how requests are distributed using the weighted round robin algorithm. Two backend <span id="elb_pro_0003__text1263703874517">server</span>s are in the same AZ and have the same weight, and each <span id="elb_pro_0003__text7688194514452">server</span> receives the same proportion of requests.</p>
<span class="figcap"><b>Figure 1 </b>Traffic distribution using the weighted round robin algorithm</span><br><span><img id="elb_pro_0003__image173432046115015" src="en-us_image_0000001160373426.png"></span>
</li><li id="elb_pro_0003__li06431114312">Weighted least connections: In addition to the weight assigned to each server, the number of connections processed by each backend server is also considered. Requests are routed to the server with the lowest connections-to-weight ratio. In addition to the number of connections, each server is assigned a weight based on its capacity. Requests are routed to the server with the lowest connections-to-weight ratio. This algorithm is often used for persistent connections, such as connections to a database.<p id="elb_pro_0003__p7925102765415"><a name="elb_pro_0003__li06431114312"></a><a name="li06431114312"></a>The following figure shows an example of how requests are distributed using the weighted least connections algorithm. Two backend servers are in the same AZ and have the same weight, 100 connections have been established with backend server 01, and 50 connections have been connected with backend server 02. New requests are preferentially routed to backend server 02.</p>

</li><li id="elb_pro_0003__li1028712421427">Source IP hash: The source IP address of each request is calculated using the consistent hashing algorithm to obtain a unique hashing key, and all backend servers are numbered. The generated key is used to allocate the client to a particular server. This allows requests from different clients to be routed based on source IP addresses and ensures that a client is directed to the same server that it was using previously. This algorithm works well for TCP connections of load balancers that do not use cookies.<p id="elb_pro_0003__p166892034185613"><a name="elb_pro_0003__li1028712421427"></a><a name="li1028712421427"></a>The following figure shows an example of how requests are distributed using the source IP hash algorithm.
