<div id="body8662426"><p id="modelarts_23_0326__en-us_topic_0266024075_p933619101389">Jupyter Notebook is a web-based application for interactive computing. It can be applied to full-process computing: development, documentation, running code, and presenting results.</p>
<p id="modelarts_23_0326__en-us_topic_0266024075_p11517399819">ModelArts integrates the open-source Jupyter Notebook. After creating a notebook instance, you can open the instance for development without the need for installation and configuration.</p>

ModelArts Notebook supports multiple kernel types. A code execution environment contains the pre-installed and commissioned AI engines and dependencies.</li><li id="modelarts_23_0326__en-us_topic_0266024075_li1736912501006">When a kernel is selected to open a notebook instance, an IPython process is started at the backend of the notebook instance as the running environment to execute the code and command input on the page.</li><li id="modelarts_23_0326__en-us_topic_0266024075_li93691507010">Each kernel type contains an independent Conda running environment to ensure that the AI engines are independent of each other. For example, if the Keras library is updated in a kernel of the TensorFlow type, the kernel of the MindSpore type will not be affected.</li></ul>

Compared with a Python interpreter, a notebook kernel can execute shell scripts and integrate more visualized tools and magic commands.
