What problems do you want to solve? What is the business goal? Sort out the AI development framework and ideas based on the business understanding. For example, image classification and object detection. Different projects have different requirements for data and AI development methods.</p>

<p id="modelarts_01_0010__en-us_topic_0284258735_en-us_topic_0168462752_p3809863175123">Data preparation is the basis of AI development. When you collect and integrate related data based on the determined objective, the most important thing is to ensure the authenticity and reliability of the obtained data. Typically, you cannot collect all the data at the same time. In the data labeling phase, you may find that some data sources are missing and then you may need to repeatedly adjust and optimize the data.</p>

After model training, usually one or more machine learning or deep learning models are generated. These models can be applied to new data to obtain predictions and evaluation results.</p>

Typically, you cannot obtain a satisfactory model after the first evaluation, and may need to repeatedly adjust algorithm parameters and data to further optimize the model.</p>
<p id="modelarts_01_0010__en-us_topic_0284258735_en-us_topic_0168462752_p10111824916">Some common metrics, such as the accuracy, recall, and area under the curve (AUC), help you effectively evaluate and obtain a satisfactory model.</p>

After a satisfactory model is obtained, the model needs to be formally applied to actual data or newly generated data for prediction, evaluation, and visualization. The findings can then be reported to decision makers in an intuitive way, helping them develop the right business strategies.</p>
