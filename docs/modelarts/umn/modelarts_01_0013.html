ModelArts supports all popular AI computing frameworks and provides a user-friendly development and debugging environment. It supports traditional machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision tree, and clustering, as well as multiple types of deep learning algorithms, such as the convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM).</p>

For existing open-source frameworks, algorithm developers need to write a large amount of code for distributed training on different hardware, and the acceleration code varies depending on the framework. To resolve these issues, a distributed lightweight framework or SDK is required. The framework or SDK is built on deep learning engines such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, MXNet, and MindSpore to improve the distributed performance and usability of these engines. ModelArts MoXing perfectly suits the needs. The easy-to-use MoXing API/SDK enables you to develop deep learning at low costs. </p>
