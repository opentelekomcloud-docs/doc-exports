It can be considered as learning with a teacher. Common supervised learning includes regression and classification.</li><li id="modelarts_01_0011__en-us_topic_0284258736_en-us_topic_0129439808_li1946282263318">Unsupervised learning is used to find hidden structures in unlabeled data. Clustering is a form of unsupervised learning.</li><li id="modelarts_01_0011__en-us_topic_0284258736_en-us_topic_0129439808_li2236194817355">Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.</li></ul>

Regression mainly analyzes data and predicts data and data relationship. Regression can be used for customer development, retention, customer churn prevention, production lifecycle analysis, sales trend prediction, and targeted promotion.</p>

Classification can be used for customer classification, customer properties, feature analysis, customer satisfaction analysis, and customer purchase trend prediction.</p>

Objects are grouped based on the maximized and minimized similarities to form clusters. In this way, objects in the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters.</p>
