<p id="modelarts_03_0146__en-us_topic_0181004301_p1844161723317">By default, new IAM users do not have permissions assigned. You need to add a user to one or more groups, and attach permissions policies or roles to these groups. Users inherit permissions from the groups to which they are added and can perform specified operations on cloud services based on the permissions.</p>

<p id="modelarts_03_0146__en-us_topic_0181004301_p1845161753311">An account has all the permissions required to call all APIs, but IAM users must be assigned the required permissions. The permissions required for calling an API are determined by the actions supported by the API. Only users who have been granted permissions allowing the actions can call the API successfully. For example, if an IAM user wants to query ECSs using an API, the user must have been granted permissions that allow the <strong id="modelarts_03_0146__en-us_topic_0181004301_b524542111610">modelarts:notebook:create</strong> action.</p>

You can also create custom policies and use them to supplement system-defined policies, implementing more refined access control. Operations supported by policies are specific to APIs. The following are common concepts related to policies:</p>
