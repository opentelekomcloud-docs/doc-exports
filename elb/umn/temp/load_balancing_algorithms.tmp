<h1 class="topictitle1">Load Balancing Algorithms</h1>
<p id="elb_ug_jt_0003__p135641815104519">Load balancers receive requests from clients and forward them to backend servers in one or more AZs. Each load balancer has at least a listener and a backend server. The load balancing algorithm you select when you add the listener determines how requests are distributed.</p>

Backend servers with higher weights receive proportionately more requests, whereas equal-weighted servers receive the same number of requests. This algorithm is often used for short connections, such as HTTP connections.<p id="elb_ug_jt_0003__elb_pro_0003_p16438104524911"><a name="elb_ug_jt_0003__elb_pro_0003_li1728610427215"></a><a name="elb_pro_0003_li1728610427215"></a>The following figure shows an example of how requests are distributed using the weighted round robin algorithm.

Requests are routed to the server with the lowest connections-to-weight ratio. In addition to the number of connections, each server is assigned a weight based on its capacity. Requests are routed to the server with the lowest connections-to-weight ratio. This algorithm is often used for persistent connections, such as connections to a database.<p id="elb_ug_jt_0003__elb_pro_0003_p7925102765415"><a name="elb_ug_jt_0003__elb_pro_0003_li06431114312"></a><a name="elb_pro_0003_li06431114312"></a>The following figure shows an example of how requests are distributed using the weighted least connections algorithm. Two backend servers are in the same AZ and have the same weight, 100 connections have been established with backend server 01, and 50 connections have been connected with backend server 02. New requests are preferentially routed to backend server 02.</p>

The generated key is used to allocate the client to a particular server. This allows requests from different clients to be routed based on source IP addresses and ensures that a client is directed to the same server that it was using previously.
