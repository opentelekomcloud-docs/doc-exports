<h4 class="sectiontitle">Inbound Network Traffic Paths</h4>The listeners' configurations determine how load balancers distribute incoming traffic.<span class="figcap"><b>Figure 1 </b>Inbound network traffic</span><br><span><img class="vsd" id="elb_ug_fz_0003_01__elb_ug_fz_0003_image5021893716" src="en-us_image_0000001181376003.png"></span>
